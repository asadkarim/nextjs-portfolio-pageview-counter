How I Tackled It:

Configured Business Central fund accounting modules to track donations and grants.

Automated recurring donor workflows and grant reporting using Power Automate.

Created dashboards in Excel for financial visibility across programs.

Trained finance and program managers for accurate reporting and adoption.
Outcome:

Faster grant and donation reporting, reduced manual effort by 40%.

Improved transparency for donors and board members.

Unified financial reporting across multiple programs.
