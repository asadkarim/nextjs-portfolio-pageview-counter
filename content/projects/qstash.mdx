How I Tackled It:

Conducted thorough data assessment and cleansing of GP financials, vendors, and project data.

Configured Business Central multi-company setup to reflect all ongoing projects and departments.

Designed job-costing workflows, automated project invoicing, and integrated reporting dashboards with Power BI.

Developed Power Automate flows for automated approval and alerts on budget overruns.

Led end-to-end team training to ensure smooth adoption for project managers and finance staff.
Outcome:

Seamless migration from GP with zero data loss.

30% improvement in project reporting speed and accuracy.

Reduced manual intervention in job costing and approvals by 40%.
