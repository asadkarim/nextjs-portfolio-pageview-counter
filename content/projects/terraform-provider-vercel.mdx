Goal: Transition from GP to Business Central to unify multiple warehouses, streamline order processing, and consolidate financials.
How I Tackled It:

Analyzed GP setup and mapped all inventory, warehouse, and financial data for migration.

Configured Business Central for multi-warehouse management, intercompany transactions, and consolidated financial reporting.

Implemented automated inventory replenishment and order processing workflows using Power Automate.

Guided the team through hands-on training sessions and post-migration support.
Outcome:

Successful GP-to-BC migration completed on schedule with accurate financial and inventory data.

35% faster order processing and improved warehouse efficiency.

Consolidated reporting allowed executive management to make data-driven decisions quickly.
It was a fun project and I learned a lot about Terraform and Vercel's API. 
It gave me the opportunity to contribute to the Terraform ecosystem and my appreciation for the work that the Terraform team does is immense.

There have been quite a few individuals and teams that have used this provider and I am happy that it has been useful to you.

Now that Vercel have stepped in, I have decided to [deprecate](https://twitter.com/chronark_/status/1517759708983177218) this one on April 23rd, 2022. 

Please use the [official provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/vercel/vercel/latest) instead.
